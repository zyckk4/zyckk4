Greetings! I'm an enthusiast and an active participant in the open-source community.

## Interest

Python, C, x86 assembly language, operating system, computer hardware, ...

## Some of my projects

1. [haoshen_bot](https://github.com/zyckk4/haoshen_bot): A multifunctional QQ bot based on YiriMirai.
2. [html-toolbox-chatgpt](https://github.com/zyckk4/html-toolbox-chatgpt): A project that includes various tools and games written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS with the help of ChatGPT4.

One highlight in my coding journey was making a contribution to CPython, which, despite being a documentation typo fix, was an encouraging and significant milestone for me. This experience encouraged me and reinforced my passion for continuous skill improvement and contributing to open-source projects. My journey thus far has been exciting and fulfilling, and I look forward to the many projects and challenges ahead.

Feel free to follow my work or reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate. I'm always open to meeting new people in the tech community!
